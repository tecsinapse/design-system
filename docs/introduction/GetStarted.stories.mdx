# Get started
Below contains instructions on how to use the design-system in web and native applications (React and React Native)

## Install

`yarn add @tecsinapse/react-core`  Contains components in common between web and native. <br/>
`yarn add @tecsinapse/react-native-kit` Contains components specific to native applications. <br/>
`yarn add @tecsinapse/react-web-kit` Contains web-specific components.

### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

`import { ThemeProvider, Button, lightTheme } from ‘@tecsinapse/react-native-kit’;`

and use them like so

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
    <Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked')}>Button</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

**NOTE: All core components are exported from platform specific packages. Prefer using only one dependency, in case of any significant change for platform specific code.**

### Install react-native-vector-icons

Because some components use those internally, you will need to install **react-native-vector-icons**.
Expo or create-react-native-app projects include react-native-vector-icons out of the box, hence this step can be skipped.
If your project is a standard React Native project created using `react-native init` (it should have an ios/android directory), then you need to install.

### Developing

Running locally

```

    yarn install && yarn storybook

```
