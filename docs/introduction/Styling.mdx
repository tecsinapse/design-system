# Styling components

In TecSinapse Design System, we believe in a hybrid approach for many components, to simplify the development of beautiful UI's on web or mobile platforms (native).
To achieve this, the team has opted to use [*@emotion*](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) as main styling system, enjoying maximum as possible the reuse of code for styled components.

**Make sure to read [important considerations](#important-considerations).**

## Installation

`yarn add @emotion/react` Required for *emotion* system. <br/>
`yarn add @emotion/styled` Required for styling components in web. <br/>
`yarn add @emotion/native` Required for styling hybrid and native components. <br/>

### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

```js
import {
  ThemeProvider,
  Button,
  lightTheme,
} from '@tecsinapse/react-native-kit';
import styled from '@emotion/native';
```

and use them like so

```jsx
const StyledButton = styled(Button)`
  background-color: red;
`;

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
    <StyledButton onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked')}>
      Button
    </StyledButton>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

### Accessing theme

You can access all theme properties as follows

```jsx
import {
  useTheme,
  ThemeProvider,
  Button,
  lightTheme,
} from '@tecsinapse/react-web-kit';

const App = () => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: theme.color.primary.medium }}>
        Theme background color
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

## Important considerations

Because of the nature of each platform and *emotion* system doesn't have a solution to this, to extend hybrid components in web, you must inject `@emotion/native` styled function.
This happens because style property doesn't operate between platforms, so is probable that your hybrid components will not receive the correct style treatment.
Even with *react-native-web*, the styles are spread in component level, and the *emotion* system convert it to *react-native* stylesheet.
