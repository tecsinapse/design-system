## Code of Conduct

We want to foster an inclusive and friendly community around our Open Source efforts.
This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. Please, [read it and follow it](https://github.com/tecsinapse/design-system/tree/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you feel another member of the community violated this code or you are experiencing problems participating in our community because of another individual's behavior,

## Submitting an issue

In most cases, submitting an issue is the first step to contributing to our DS. Check the existing issues and verify that your issue is not already submitted.

## Submitting a pull request

We appreciate pull requests (PRs) for smaller changes and bug fixes. For larger changes, we encourage you to [submit an issue](https://github.com/tecsinapse/design-system/issues/new) to collect feedback first. The normal workflow looks as follows:

1. Let others know that you're working on an issue by leaving a comment or assigning it to yourself.
2. Clone the repository (you might need to fork it first) and branch out from the latest `master` branch.
3. Code, add, commit, and push your changes in your feature branch.
4. Submit a pull request and make sure that the CI checks pass.
5. Collaborate with the code owners/reviewers to merge your changes to `master`.
