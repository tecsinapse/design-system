# Welcome to [TecSinapse](https://www.tecsinapse.com.br/) Design System

This repository implements the TecSinapse design system to facilitate the development of front end applications, whether web or mobile.
This project continues to evolve, seeking to be increasingly accessible and easy to use, so pay attention to the steps described and
the observations provided, as several tools and alternatives are provided to extend your application.

# Installation & Usage

On the left menu you will find instructions on how to install, customize and design components.

# Available Options

If you are starting a web-only project, it is recommended to use the **Cortex** (`@tecsinapse/cortex-react`) system,
designed to be easily extensible with _tailwindcss_ and performant in _browsers_.

For mobile projects, we recommend using `@tecsinapse/react-native-kit` for the base components and [`nativewind`](https://www.nativewind.dev/)
to customize the screen layout.

## @tecsinapse/cortex-react

Most recent proposal for the design system to be used in _client_ or _server side_ applications, focused on providing a simplified and modular interface.
To configure and install, access the guide in the menu on the left.
Knowledge about [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/) is recommended.

The primitives are provided by `@tecsinapse/cortex-core` as [`tailwind-variants`](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) javascript functions,
being easily reusable in others frameworks besides reactjs.

## @tecsinapse/react-web-kit

First version of the design system using _styled-components_ [`@emotion/styled`](https://emotion.sh/) _CSS in JS_,
designed for maximum reuse between native mobile and web apps, using `react-native- web` as a compatibility layer.

## @tecsinapse/react-native-kit

Based on _styled-components_ system [`@emotion/native`](https://emotion.sh/) _CSS in JS_, unifying react development on a _mobile first_ shared API.
