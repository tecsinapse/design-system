```
yarn dev
```

If you add new stories on the native (ondevice version) you either need to have the watcher running or run the stories loader

To update the stories one time (it runs before start)

```
yarn update:stories
```

To watch the stories files (this is called with run scripts)

```
yarn watch:stories
```

Note that this is only necessary for when you add or remove a story file.
