# rn-playground

Please follow the [React native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment?os=linux&platform=android).
This package is a sample React Native application with all required dependencies. In the [repository docs](https://tecsinapse.github.io/design-system) 
you will find all steps to start your application.

After you configure the SDK and emulator (or your device), you can run the platform command to run the playground app locally. 
It will be used android as example.

```shell
pnpm android
```

This will install Expo Go and run metro server.

If you already have Expo Go installed, just run `pnpm run:dev` to start metro server.

Please follow same directives of the root directory (run `pnpm dev`) to watch file changes. Sometimes Expo Go can be unstable, 
so restarting the app may solve some issues.
